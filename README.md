# Heavy Plates Gym 

I've created a single page website for a fictive gym.
for people with a competative mindset.

 
## UX
 
- Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This website is for everyone whos intrested about getting fit and move on to a more competative level.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

As a training enthusiast I want to simply log in to this page and register to any membership to reach my goals to become a competative bodybuilder.

- This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

I started off by sketching on a piece of paper how i would want my website to look
at first i was thinking of making a three page website but changed my mind to just make a single page website 
because it made the page easier to navigate. 
It made it easier for the user to go trough the page with ease without having to navigate to different pages
cause the content is quite simple.
## Features
About section: welcomes you to my gym and and tells the history behind it.

Membership section: Has a Registration Form and the prising of the Gym.

Event section: Is where I post new upcoming events.
 
### Existing Features
 I have a navbar that has a neat scroll to the different sections of the page.

 A table with information of the different memberships.

 A registration form where you sign up

 social media links in the footer so users can follow Us and see upcoming events.

- In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

 Add a login with a password so you can go to a personal page so you can change your membership signup for different events .

### Features Left to Implement
 Add a chat function

## Technologies Used
html5

css

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

Font Awsome for the social links 

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Membership page and Registration form"

    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears

    works as intended

    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears

    works as intended

    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

    works like it should

-In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

I tested the webpage on a iphone 6 ,galaxy 10 , ipad , laptop and a desktop all worked as intended

I also did a test in different browsers such as

Google chrome

Firefox

Edge

- You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

GitPod was bugging so sometimes everything looked great and sometimes it looked like i didnt style anything at all

I also validated the web page buy using the url on https://validator.w3.org/ and all files passed the validation test

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
I used GitPOd and deployed it git add . git commit -m"changes goes here" git push to push everything to GitHub


I deployed the website by going to GitHub choosing the milestoneproject1 respository
i selecterd the master branch which allows to host the page.
